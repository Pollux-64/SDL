you can use these commands to download these libaries:

python3 -m pip install -U pip

python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib

SDL1 - Dot product and vectors:
The program will print these the resluts for two vectors and graph it:

1.Dot product

2.Magnitude

3.Law of cosine


Disclaimer:

The graph size will have to be adjusted manually if it exceeds the window and all vectors have a base at the orgin.

SDL2 - Conics and Arc length
The program will ask the user which of 4 graphs they want to view. 

It will then return the graph with it's arc length in the title.

the function work is not finished but would have calculated the work of the curve in a given vector field
